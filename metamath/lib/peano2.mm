            CLASSICAL FIRST-ORDER LOGIC WITH EQUALITY
###############################################################################

  Logic can be defined as the "study of the principles of correct reasoning"
  (Merrilee H. Salmon's 1991 "Informal Reasoning and Informal Logic" in
  _Informal Reasoning and Education_) or as "a formal system using symbolic
  techniques and mathematical methods to establish truth-values" (the Oxford
  English Dictionary).

  This section formally defines the logic system we will use.  In particular,
  it defines symbols for declaring truthful statements, along with rules for
  deriving truthful statements from other truthful statements.  The system
  defined here is classical first-order logic with equality (the most common
  logic system used by mathematicians).

  We begin with a few housekeeping items in pre-logic, and then introduce
  propositional calculus (both its axioms and important theorems that can be
  derived from them).  Propositional calculus deals with general truths about
  well-formed formulas (wffs) regardless of how they are constructed.  This is
  followed by proofs that other axiomatizations of classical propositional
  calculus can be derived from the axioms we have chosen to use.

  We then define predicate calculus, which adds additional symbols and rules
  useful for discussing objects (beyond simply true or false).  In particular,
  it introduces the symbols ` = ` ("equals"), ` e. ` ("is a member of"), and `
  A. ` ("for all").  The first two are called "predicates."  A predicate
  specifies a true or false relationship between its two arguments.

  Propositional calculus deals with general truths about well-formed formulas
  (wffs) regardless of how they are constructed.  The simplest propositional
  truth is ` ( ph -> ph ) ` , which can be read "if something is true, then it
  is true" - rather trivial and obvious, but nonetheless it must be proved from
  the axioms (see theorem ~ id ).

  Our system of propositional calculus consists of three basic axioms and
  another axiom that defines the modus-ponens inference rule.  It is attributed
  to Jan Lukasiewicz (pronounced woo-kah-SHAY-vitch) and was popularized by
  Alonzo Church, who called it system P2.  (Thanks to Ted Ulrich for this
  information.)  These axioms are ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , ~ ax-3 , and (for modus
  ponens) ~ ax-mp . Some closely followed texts include [Margaris] for the
  axioms and [WhiteheadRussell] for the theorems.

  The propositional calculus used here is the classical system widely used by
  mathematicians.  In particular, this logic system accepts the "law of the
  excluded middle" as proven in ~ exmid , which says that a logical statement
  is either true or not true.  This is an essential distinction of classical
  logic and is not a theorem of intuitionistic logic.

  All 194 axioms, definitions, and theorems for propositional calculus in
  _Principia Mathematica_ (specifically *1.2 through *5.75) are axioms or
  formally proven.  See the Bibliographic Cross-References at
  ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmbiblio.html for a complete
  cross-reference from sources used to its formalization in the Metamath
  Proof Explorer.

  $( If ` ph ` is a wff, so is ` -. ph ` or "not ` ph ` ."  Part of the
     recursive definition of a wff (well-formed formula).  In classical logic
     (which is our logic), a wff is interpreted as either true or false.  So if
     ` ph ` is true, then ` -. ph ` is false; if ` ph ` is false, then
     ` -. ph ` is true.  Traditionally, Greek letters are used to represent
     wffs, and we follow this convention.  In propositional calculus, we define
     only wffs built up from other wffs, i.e. there is no starting or "atomic"
     wff.  Later, in predicate calculus, we will extend the basic wff
     definition by including atomic wffs ( ~ weq and ~ wel ). $)
  wn $a wff -. ph $.

  $( If ` ph ` and ` ps ` are wff's, so is ` ( ph -> ps ) ` or " ` ph ` implies
     ` ps ` ."  Part of the recursive definition of a wff.  The resulting wff
     is (interpreted as) false when ` ph ` is true and ` ps ` is false; it is
     true otherwise.  Think of the truth table for an OR gate with input ` ph `
     connected through an inverter.  After we define the axioms of
     propositional calculus ( ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , ~ ax-3 , and ~ ax-mp ), the
     biconditional ( ~ df-bi ), the constant true ` T. ` ( ~ df-tru ), and the
     constant false ` F. ` ( ~ df-fal ), we will be able to prove these truth
     table values: ` ( ( T. -> T. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ truimtru ),
     ` ( ( T. -> F. ) <-> F. ) ` ( ~ truimfal ), ` ( ( F. -> T. ) <-> T. ) `
     ( ~ falimtru ), and ` ( ( F. -> F. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ falimfal ).  These
     have straightforward meanings, for example, ` ( ( T. -> T. ) <-> T. ) `
     just means "the value of ` ( T. -> T. ) ` is ` T. ` ".

     The left-hand wff is called the antecedent, and the right-hand wff is
     called the consequent.  In the case of ` ( ph -> ( ps -> ch ) ) ` , the
     middle ` ps ` may be informally called either an antecedent or part of the
     consequent depending on context.  Contrast with ` <-> ` ( ~ df-bi ),
     ` /\ ` ( ~ df-an ), and ` \/ ` ( ~ df-or ).

     This is called "material implication" and the arrow is usually read as
     "implies."  However, material implication is not identical to the meaning
     of "implies" in natural language.  For example, the word "implies" may
     suggest a causal relationship in natural language.  Material implication
     does not require any causal relationship.  Also, note that in material
     implication, if the consequent is true then the wff is always true (even
     if the antecedent is false).  Thus, if "implies" means material
     implication, it is true that "if the moon is made of green cheese that
     implies that 5=5" (because 5=5).  Similarly, if the antecedent is false,
     the wff is always true.  Thus, it is true that, "if the moon made of green
     cheese that implies that 5=7" (because the moon is not actually made of
     green cheese).  A contradiction implies anything ( ~ pm2.21i ).  In short,
     material implication has a very specific technical definition, and
     misunderstandings of it are sometimes called "paradoxes of logical
     implication." $)

        The axioms of propositional calculus
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  Propositional calculus (axioms ~ ax-1 through ~ ax-3 and rule ~ ax-mp ) can
  be thought of as asserting formulas that are universally "true" when their
  variables are replaced by any combination of "true" and "false."
  Propositional calculus was first formalized by Frege in 1879, using as his
  axioms (in addition to rule ~ ax-mp ) the wffs ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , ~ pm2.04 ,
  ~ con3 , ~ notnot2 , and ~ notnot1 . Around 1930, Lukasiewicz simplified the
  system by eliminating the third (which follows from the first two, as you can
  see by looking at the proof of ~ pm2.04 ) and replacing the last three with
  our ~ ax-3 . (Thanks to Ted Ulrich for this information.)

  The theorems of propositional calculus are also called _tautologies_.
  Tautologies can be proved very simply using truth tables, based on the
  true/false interpretation of propositional calculus.  To do this, we assign
  all possible combinations of true and false to the wff variables and verify
  that the result (using the rules described in ~ wi and ~ wn ) always
  evaluates to true.  This is called the _semantic_ approach.  Our approach is
  called the _syntactic_ approach, in which everything is derived from axioms.
  A metatheorem called the Completeness Theorem for Propositional Calculus
  shows that the two approaches are equivalent and even provides an algorithm
  for automatically generating syntactic proofs from a truth table.  Those
  proofs, however, tend to be long, since truth tables grow exponentially with
  the number of variables, and the much shorter proofs that we show here were
  found manually.

    $( Rule of Modus Ponens.  The postulated inference rule of propositional
       calculus.  See e.g.  Rule 1 of [Hamilton] p. 73.  The rule says, "if
       ` ph ` is true, and ` ph ` implies ` ps ` , then ` ps ` must also be
       true."  This rule is sometimes called "detachment," since it detaches
       the minor premise from the major premise.  "Modus ponens" is short for
       "modus ponendo ponens," a Latin phrase that means "the mode that by
       affirming affirms" - remark in [Sanford] p. 39.  This rule is similar to
       the rule of modus tollens ~ mto .

       Note:  In some web page displays such as the Statement List, the
       symbols " ` & ` " and " ` => ` " informally indicate the relationship
       between the hypotheses and the assertion (conclusion), abbreviating the
       English words "and" and "implies."  They are not part of the formal
       language.  (Contributed by NM, 30-Sep-1992.) $)

     simplification" in _Principia Mathematica_ (Theorem *2.02 of
     [WhiteheadRussell] p. 100) because "it enables us to pass from the joint
     assertion of ` ph ` and ` ps ` to the assertion of ` ph ` simply."  It is

     as _Frege_ in the literature; see Proposition 2 of [Frege1879] p. 26.  It
     is also proved as Theorem *2.77 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 108.  The other

     statement "if there are no clouds in the sky, it is not raining" implies
     the statement "if it is raining, there are clouds in the sky."  This axiom
     is called _Transp_ or "the principle of transposition" in _Principia
     Mathematica_ (Theorem *2.17 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 103).  We will also
     use the term "contraposition" for this principle, although the reader is
     advised that in the field of philosophical logic, "contraposition" has a
     different technical meaning.  (Contributed by NM, 30-Sep-1992.) $)
